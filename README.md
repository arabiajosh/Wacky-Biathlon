## Introduction

Welcome to the Wacky Biathlon World Championships! Congratulations on making it to this stage, but the hardest challenge still lies ahead of you. This event will consist of multiple timed rounds, and the competitor with the lowest cumulative time at the end of all the rounds will win. In each round you’ll have five targets to hit, but there’s a catch. You’ll only be able to fire in specific stances, and you won’t know what those are until you get to the shooting range. Remember, for every target you miss you have to make one full circuit of the penalty loop before your time can stop. So shoot straight, ski fast, and good luck!


## Setup

Plug a single controller into the console, and the light rifle into the ACC port. Locate and shuffle the stance cards, and determine a shooting line that all players should shoot from behind. 


## Play

Before starting, players should shuffle all of the shooting stance cards, and place the pile in the middle of the play area. Each player should then designate a spotter who will position the targets for them during their turn. Players should finally determine a start order, and decide how many rounds the game will consist of (The developers recommend 3 as a good starting number).

During each round, one player at a time steps into the athlete role, and their selected spotters take up the spotter role. Once the player is ready to begin, the clock starts and they draw their stance card. Following the directives of that card, the athlete attempts to shoot the active target, which the spotter has positioned in the leftmost circle of the overlay. After each shot the athlete takes, the spotter declares “hit” or “miss”, then moves the active target one circle to the right, resetting it if necessary. If for any shot, the athlete takes a shot from in front of the designated shooting line, any other players can declare “penalty”, and the shot is considered missed.

After the fifth shot has been taken, the athlete hands off the rifle to the spotter, and takes the controller they were using to move the target. The athlete then must maneuver their dot to the start line of the penalty loop, on the bottom section of the overlay. They must then complete one lap for every missed shot they made this round, up to a total of five possible laps. Once they have completed their final penalty lap, their turn is complete and the time is stopped.

If at any point players work their way through the entire stance card deck, simply reshuffle all the cards and replace the deck.


## Game End

The game ends when the designated number of rounds have been completed. Once this has happened, total each player’s round times to determine who made the podium and who did not.
